# Bio-511-BT-Analysis

This .csv file contains data on the fecundity, weight, and length of bull trout specimens. These data were collected from authors, publicly available articles, and through my own work with Dr. Scholz.

I plan to use GLMs (likely Poisson regression) to model the relationship between bull trout weight and fecundity. I also want to model bull trout lengths against fecundity. I hope to be able to compare the models to determine the best possible model for predicting bull trout fecundity in a non lethal manner. 

Not included in this .csv are more data points for length and fecundity from other studies, but no others studies also included weight. I was hoping to make a model that could predict bull trout fecundity for any fish length and, by extension, any life history form a bull trout exhibits.
